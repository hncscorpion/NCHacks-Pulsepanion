# Smart Summarization for Caregivers

Smart Summarization is a lightweight, AI-assisted tool designed to help caregivers quickly understand trends in patient health data over time. Users can generate natural-language summaries of patient vitals, observations, and activities over a selected time range, then export reports as PDF files.

## Features

- Selectable date ranges (e.g 07-011-2024, 07-011-2025)
- AI-based summarization using GPT or rule-based logic
- Downloadable reports in PDF format
- Simple, caregiver-friendly UI built with RShiny

## Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, OpenAI API)
- Version control: Git + GitHub

## Project Goal

Build a working prototype by July 13, 2025, including:
- A functioning UI with summarization
- Downloadable PDF reports
- Presentation-ready slide deck (5â€“6 slides)

## Status

In progress. Dataset merging and UI skeleton underway.
