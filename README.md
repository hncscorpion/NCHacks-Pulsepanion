# Smart Summarization for Caregivers

Smart Summarization is a lightweight, AI-assisted tool designed to help caregivers quickly understand trends in patient health data over time. Users can generate natural-language summaries of patient vitals, observations, and activities over a selected time range, then export reports as PDF files.

## Features

- Selectable date ranges (e.g., today, last 7 days, custom range)
- AI-based summarization using GPT or rule-based logic
- Downloadable reports in PDF format
- Simple, caregiver-friendly UI built with Streamlit

## Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, OpenAI API)
- PDF generation: pdfkit or WeasyPrint
- Version control: Git + GitHub
